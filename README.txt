crobar: A tool to make multiplayer work for The Talos Principle

WARNING: The Talos Principle was NOT designed with multiplayer in mind.
Expect the game to crash left right and centre.
When this crashes, DO NOT COMPLAIN TO CROTEAM, COMPLAIN TO US INSTEAD.
Croteam deliberately disabled multiplayer on this game,
and by using this tool, sooner or later you will find out why.

There's a lot of stuff we will need to patch.
